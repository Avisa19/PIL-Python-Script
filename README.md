# PIL-Python-Script
Scale and convert images using PIL

This is the challenge section of the lab where you'll write a script that uses PIL to perform the following operations:

Iterate through each file in the folder
For each file:
Rotate the image 90° clockwise
Resize the image from 192x192 to 128x128
Save the image to a new folder in .jpeg format
Use a nano editor for this purpose. You can name the file however you'd like. And make sure to save the updated images in the folder: /opt/icons/
